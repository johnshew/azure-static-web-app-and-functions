# Azure Static Web App with Azure Functions

[Azure Static Web Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/overview) allows you to easily build JavaScript apps. 

For low traffic sites there is no charge.

You can now use [Azure Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/add-api?tabs=vanilla-javascript) as well.

This example is deployed [here](https://azure-static-web-app-and-functions.shew.net).
